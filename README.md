This method no longer works. If someone impliments a method using symlinks, then I will push it into the main repository. Otherwise I will no longer be focusing on [this](https://github.com/EpicKitten/PUBG-Replay-Manager) project
# PUBG-Map-Chooser
Allows you to disable and enable map files for PUBG

Check maps you want to play and uncheck the ones you don't. Recheck them and to enable them again.
After disabling a map, when PUBG attempts to join a server using that map, it will kick you without delay
